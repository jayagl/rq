						A sensory escape to the wilderness of southwestern Tasmania.
					<!-- </p>

						Three days and two wild nights.
					<!-- </p>
					<p> -->
						Nature, scenery, isolation.
					<!-- </p>
					<p> -->
						On the shores of the vast <a href="#location">Lake Pedder</a>. Dancing, dreaming of a submerged crystalline beach.
					</p>
					<p>
						A curated selection of the best musical and visual <a href="#lineup">artists</a> from Australia and beyond.
					<!-- </p>
					</p> -->
						And with no more than 500 <a href="#tickets">tickets available</a>, we’re keeping it cosy;
						split between 300 camping &amp; 200 at the <a href="#tickets">Lake Pedder Wilderness Lodge</a>.
					</p><br>
					<p class="quote small"><i>
						"Enter an endless subterranean cavern, where jeweled rocks loom out of the spectral gloom like marine plants, the sprays of glass forming white fountains. An immense multi-colored bird erupts from a bough over your head, flying off with a wild screech, aureoles of light cascading from its red and yellow wings. At last the storm subsided, and a pale light filtered through the stained-glass canopy. Again, the forest was a place of rainbows, a deep, iridescent light glowing from within.”

						Originally a glacial outwash lake in 1972 before the Serpentine &amp; Huon rivers were dammed,
						lake Pedder was expanded considerably from its original size to generate hydro-electricity.
						The original Lake Pedder was submerged along with its striking beach of pink quartz sand.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rose Quartz Festival acknowledges Tasmanian Aboriginal peoples as the traditional owners of the land on which we are meeting.
